## **Overview of the Project**

The **Quiz Game** is a console-based application developed in **C++** that presents multiple-choice questions to users. It keeps track of the user's score and provides feedback based on their answers. This project demonstrates the use of conditional statements, loops, and data structures for interactive and logical gameplay.

## **Objectives**
- To develop an interactive and educational quiz game.  
- To demonstrate proficiency in:
  - Managing user inputs and validating answers.  
  - Using conditional logic and loops for flow control.  
  - Keeping track of user scores dynamically.

## **Key Activities**
1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Defined the structure for questions and answers.  
   - Designed a command-line interface to interact with users.  

2. **Design and Implementation**:
   - Developed a data structure to store questions and options.  
   - Implemented functionality to calculate and display scores.  

3. **Testing**:
   - Tested the program with various question sets for accuracy.  
   - Ensured proper feedback for both correct and incorrect answers.

## **Features**
- Presents multiple-choice questions with four options each.  
- Tracks the user's score dynamically.  
- Provides feedback for each question:
  - "Correct" for correct answers.  
  - "Incorrect" for wrong answers, with the correct option displayed.  
- Displays the total score at the end of the quiz.
